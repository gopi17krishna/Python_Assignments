A statement executes something. The execution of a statement changes state. Execution of a statement may or           may not produces or displays a result value, it only does whatever the statement says.Every statement can be an                 expression."

    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "        Python follows a naming convension for its variable, and as 100 is an integer value, it can't be assigned as a variable         name, same is the case with floating numbers, complex numbers etc. A python variable cannot start with an integer,             although we could use it after any allowed variable or special symbol( _ ) like, Gopi100 or Gopi_100 etc. Also, there           are certain reserved keywords in python which can't be used as a variable name like list, int, str etc..\n",
    "        Eggs is neither a reserved keyword nor start with any integers or special symbols other than undescore, thus it                 perfectly follows the variable naming convension of python, therefore eggs is a valid."

    "        The above expression causes an error because in that expression there are two differnet data types, i.e. string and             integer, and it is asking the python to concatenate both of them. In python we cannot concatenate two differnet data           types. To do so we need to do the typecasting operation. We need to change the data type of other data which is the odd         one out. and then we can concatenate them ,if it is a string or add them if it is an integer.\n",
